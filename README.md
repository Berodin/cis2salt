## Goals
Convert CIS XCCDF Benchmark files to saltstack states as automated as possible

## State
As of now the python code written can successfully parse Windows Server 2016 to Windows Server 2022 CIS Benchmarks in their respective XCCDF format.

## Disclaimer
Honestly, I am no scripter, neither a programmer. This happened in my free time and the code base is probably a mess in eyes of developers. Feel free to fork it.
